# Simulink-model-for-two-tank-system
Two-Tank System Simulation and Control: A Simulink model of a two-tank system with coupled differential equations and PID controllers to regulate tank levels. Includes time and frequency domain analysis (step response, Bode plot, impulse response) using MATLAB/Simulink for performance and stability.
